		<h1>NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4000 Series Release Date, Price, Specs</h1>
		<p>Find out the latest news about the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4000 series such the release dates, specifications,
			features, and benchmarks.</p>
		<img src="img/gpu1.png" alt="">
		<h3>Note: this is a developing story.</h3>
		<p>Nvidia’s next-gen GPUs have been released. We are talking about the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 and Nvidia GeForce
			RTX
			4080 (Both 12GB and 16GB versions).</p>
		<p>To help visualize the potential of the RTX 4000 GPUs, we have considered NVIDIA’s previous GPU lineup, <a target="_blank"
				href="https://www.gpumag.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3000-series/"> the RTX 3000 series</a>, and the performance
			improvements over the RTX 2000 series.</p>
		<p>Although AMD will also be announcing their <mark> RDNA 3 series</mark> of GPUs on October 3, 2022, so make sure
			to
			check that out too!</p>
		<p>If you are interested in what the next generation of NVIDIA graphic cards will bring, this article contains the
			information you are looking for.</p>

			<h2>Release Date</h2>
			<img src="img/gpu2.jpg" alt="">
			<p>NVIDIA shared release date information only for the RTX 4090 and RTX 4080 on the September 20th event. Here
				are
				the dates:</p>
			<p>The RTX 4090 will be released on October 12th with a price tag of $1599. That’s $100 more expensive than its
				predecessor, the RTX 3090.</p>
			<p>At the same event, Jensen Huang also announced that the RTX 4080 will come in two iterations. A 16GB and a
				12GB
				version.</p>
			<p>However, there may be a big difference between the 16GB and 12GB RTX 4080 in terms of performance, but more
				on
				that later.</p>
			<p>For the rest of the lineup, we’ll get more information as the 4090 and 4080 release.
				Bear in mind that NVIDIA might be taking a slower approach for the release of the RTX 4000 series <br> to
				try
				and
				sell
				the excess stock of RTX 3000 GPUs.
				By 2024, they believe they will have Ampere Next Next ready, which is supposedly the RTX 5000 series.</p>
			<img src="img/gpu3.jpg" alt="">
			<p>Keep in mind that EVGA will no longer manufacture NVIDIA graphics cards. This decision is supposedly a
				consequence
				of NVIDIA’s years of mistreatment.
				EVGA’s spokesperson <br> specifically mentioned that NVIDIA kept EVGA (and probably other partners) on the
				GPU’s
				prices <br>
				and constantly undercutting them, seriously reducing their profit margins while NVIDIA’s profit margins shot
				up.
			</p>
			<p>So, unfortunately, if you want an EVGA RTX 4000 card, there won’t be any. Although, EVGA will continue
				manufacturing and warranty support for the 3000 series.</p>
			<h2>Price</h2>
			<p>We hoped that the interest drop in crypto mining and improvement in chip shortage would lead to better price
				points for future graphics cards.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, that does not seem to be the case. NVIDIA takes a completely different approach and puts
				substantially more expensive price tags on its GPUs.

				Here are the price tags:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>RTX 4060 – $330 (not confirmed)</li>
				<li>RTX 4070 – $500 (not confirmed)</li>
				<li>RTX 4080 12GB – $899</li>
				<li>RTX 4080 16GB – $1199</li>
				<li>RTX 4090 – $1599</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Switching to TSMC’s 4N process is definitely an expensive move, but does it justify a 30% (from $700 to
				$899)
				price increase? The RTX 4080 16GB variant is 56% more expensive than the 12GB RTX 3080.</p>
			<p>Additionally, the RTX 4090 is $100 more expensive than the RTX 3090. A Gigabyte GeForce RTX 4090 Gaming OC
				was
				spotted on Newegg for $1,699. So, about $100 over MSRP, while the Gaming X Tri variant is at MSRP.</p>
